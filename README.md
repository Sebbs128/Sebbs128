### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a #dotnet developer of 10 years, living in Brisbane, Australia. Currently working on Identity, Devops, security, and just generally upgrading legacy codebases (and of course too many personal side projects).

Here you'll find some of those side projects I'm comfortable with making public and/or wanting to collaborate on.

You can also find me on Mastodon [@sebbs@dotnet.social](https://dotnet.social/@sebbs).
